This site exists to demonstrate how to add user comments to a Jekyll blog hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Comments are posted to an AWS Lambda function which creates a pull request for a new data file containing the message. Once the pull request is merged, then the comment is posted.

Visit the various blog posts on this site and add some comments to see how it works!

The static comments on this site are powered by [Jekyll AWS Comments](https://github.com/mww/jekyll-aws-comments).
